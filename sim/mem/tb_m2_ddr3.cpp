// m2_ddr3: the DDR3 master.
//
// WHAT THIS HAS TO CATCH, and why it is written before the module is used.
// screen_rotate -- the framework's own example -- DOES NOT CHECK DDRAM_BUSY,
// because a video writer never backs up. A memory master that drops a request
// while BUSY is asserted has issued a read that never returns and a write that
// never lands, and neither shows up until something downstream is inexplicably
// wrong. So the BUSY tests below are the point of this bench, not decoration.
//
// The model is deliberately HOSTILE: BUSY is asserted for a settable number of
// cycles before a request is taken, and read data comes back a settable number
// after that. A bench whose memory always answers immediately proves nothing
// about a master that has to wait.
