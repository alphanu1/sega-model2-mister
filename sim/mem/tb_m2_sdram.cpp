// SDRAM controller verification.
//
// Two things are being checked at once, and they catch different faults:
//
//   DATA    every read returns what was written to that address, through a
//           shadow memory in C++. Catches address decode, burst ordering,
//           byte enables, and delivering one master's data to another.
//
//   TIMING  the device model counts zero protocol violations for the whole
//           run. Catches the failures that simulate perfectly and then eat a
//           real SDRAM stick — tRP, tRCD, refresh interval, activating an
//           already-open row.
//
// All five masters run concurrently with transactions genuinely in flight at
// the same time. Driving one port at a time would exercise the state machine
// but not the arbiter, and the arbiter is where the interesting bugs are: a
// controller that delivers p2's data to p1 passes every single-port test.

// four where blen() said 1, 2 AND 3, so port 3's burst was only ever checked
// one word deep. That is why this is a function with the real table in it and
// not a constant, and why the harness now instantiates all TEN ports: 8 and 9
// burst TWO for the TGP, a length the controller could not previously deliver
// at all -- its capture composed any non-single transfer from four slots, so a
// pair took two of its lanes from the previous transfer. A burst length that
// exists in blen() and is never driven by a test is not covered by it.
// EVERY PORT BURSTS FOUR, and that is load-bearing rather than incidental --
// see the blen() comment in m2_sdram.sv. A port with a different length
// corrupts other ports' data through the shared rd_total, which is exactly
// what ten active ports found the moment 8 and 9 asked for pairs.
