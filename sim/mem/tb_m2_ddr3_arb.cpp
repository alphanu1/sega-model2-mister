// m2_ddr3_arb: two framebuffer masters onto one DDRAM port.
//
// THE THREE THINGS THAT MATTER, and each is a way this can be silently wrong:
//   1. a granted transaction is NOT interrupted -- DDR3 beats carry no address,
//      so interleaving two masters' beats corrupts both and neither knows;
//   2. the READER wins when both ask, because it has the beam deadline;
//   3. the loser's beats are NOT delivered to the winner -- an rvalid routed to
//      the wrong port writes one master's data into the other's buffer.
//
// (3) is the one that would be hardest to find on a board: the picture would be
// subtly wrong rather than absent.

  //         both of ours do, on the first beat) has its acknowledge routed to the
  //         other port. It waits for ever.
  //
  //         So test the invariant instead of the timing: grant the reader, drop
  //         a_req the way m2_fb_read does, and require the acknowledge to still
