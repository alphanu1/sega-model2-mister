// PORTED FROM THE MODEL 1 CORE, m1_fp_pool.sv @ 78481c420327; re-taken
// at 0b5d04f (R566) for the registered operand mux, the rotated arbiter and
// the divider grant mask.
// Same author, same licence, same arithmetic. See THIRD_PARTY.md.
//
// Taken rather than rewritten because Model 1 already made and rejected the
// design this project reached for first: a private multiplier and adder inside
// the transform stage. The header below is its own reasoning, and it applies
// here unchanged -- Model 2 has the same fp_mul and fp_add, the same four-stage
// pipelines, and a geometry record of the same shape.
//
// One multiplier, one adder and one divider, shared by every geometry stage.
//
// WHY SHARED, AND THE ARITHMETIC THAT SAYS IT COSTS NOTHING
//
// The stages were first built with private units - m2_geo_xform with a multiplier
// and an adder, m2_geo_project with both plus a divider, m2_geo_det with both
// again - which is three of each. Counting what a polygon record actually needs:
//
//     transform   3 points x (9 mul, 8-9 add)   27 mul   24 add
//     determinant                                9 mul   11 add
//     projection  2 points x (4 mul, 4 add)      8 mul    8 add   2 div
//                                               --------------------------
//                                               44 mul   43 add   2 div
//
// against a budget of 68 cycles a record (docs/findings.md). fp_mul and fp_add
// are four-stage pipelines that retire one result per cycle, so ONE of each runs
// at 65% and 63%. Three of each buys nothing at all; it was convenience, not
// necessity, and it costs two multipliers and two adders.
//
// The divider is the exception and cannot be shared away: fp_div is 29 cycles and
// does not pipeline, so two reciprocals a record is 58 of the 68 on their own.
// Sharing it changes nothing because there was only ever one.
//
// ROUND ROBIN, NOT PRIORITY. At 65% utilisation a fixed priority would almost
// always be fine, and "almost always" is how a stage that is starved only on the
// busiest frames gets shipped. The rotating pointer costs a handful of LUTs.
//
// RESULTS ARE ROUTED BY A TAG PIPELINE. fp_mul and fp_add have a fixed four-cycle
// latency and retire in issue order, so the client index shifts through a
// four-deep register alongside the operands and selects which client's response
// line is raised. The divider holds a single tag, because only one division can
// be outstanding.
//
// Each client has SEPARATE multiply and add ports rather than one operation port.
// A stage frequently has a multiply and an add in flight at once - that is the
// whole point of the pipelines - and a single port would serialise them for no
// reason, then need a queue to sort the two results out again.

  // ROTATE THE REQUEST VECTOR ONCE, THEN PRIORITISE ON CONSTANTS.
  //
  // The obvious way to walk a rotated vector is to compute the rotated index
  // inside the loop and read `req[idx]`. That is what stood here, and it is
  // quadratic: the loop is unrolled NC times, `idx` is a VARIABLE in every one
  // of them, so each iteration builds its own NC:1 mux to read `req[idx]` on
  // top of its own add, compare and conditional subtract. NC of those per
  // arbiter, and there are THREE arbiters (multiply, add, divide).
  //
  // Rotating first collapses it. `{req, req} >> first` is a single barrel
  // shifter whose bit k is `req[(first + k) % NC]`, so the priority chain that
  // follows indexes with k CONSTANT - no mux at all, just a chain of CW-bit
  // selects - and the wrap arithmetic happens ONCE on the winner instead of NC
  // times on every candidate.
  //
  // One barrel shifter plus one adder per arbiter, against NC muxes plus NC
  // adders plus NC subtractors. The behaviour is identical: same rotation, same
  // priority order, same fallback to `first` when nothing is requesting.
  //
  // No loop-with-break here either - yosys rejects it, see
  // docs/rtl-conventions.md - so the chain still walks DOWN from NC-1 and lets
  // the lowest rotated index win by writing last.
