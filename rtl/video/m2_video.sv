// 2D video path: four tilemap layers, line buffered, mixed, palette mapped.
//
// STRUCTURE
//
// One fetch engine is instantiated, not four, and the four layers are rendered
// through it one after another into four line buffers. That is not a saving of
// three engines' worth of logic so much as a saving of arbitration: the
// character fetches all go to one SDRAM port, and four concurrent engines would
// need an arbiter in front of it whose only job would be to serialise them
// anyway. Sequential rendering makes the port, the tile RAM port and the decode
// datapath single-owner by construction.
//
// The cost is that the four layers' fetch times add rather than overlap, which
// is exactly the budget recorded in docs/m1-m4-plan.md: about 700 cycles per
// layer on repeated tiles against ~1025 available per layer, and about 1600 on
// entirely distinct ones. Text and menu screens fit; four dense layers do not.
//
// TIMING
//
// Everything runs on the core clock. `ce_pix` divides it to the 16 MHz dot
// clock MAME specifies, so scanout advances on ce_pix while fetch runs at full
// rate — which is the whole reason a line's worth of fetching fits inside a
// line's worth of display time.
//
// Rendering happens a line ahead. m2_video_timing raises `line_start` at the
// beginning of the horizontal blanking that precedes a line and names the line
// about to be rendered; the buffers written during that period are the ones
// scanned out next. Rendering into the buffer being displayed would need fetch
// to stay ahead of the beam, which at 1600 cycles for a dense layer it cannot.
//
// SCROLL REGISTERS LIVE IN TILE RAM
//
// draw_common reads them out of the tilemap's own RAM rather than from a
// separate register file:
//
//   hscr = tile_ram[0x5000 + (layer >> 1)]
//   vscr = tile_ram[0x5004 + (layer >> 1)]
//
// so they are fetched through the same port as everything else, two reads per
// layer per line, before that layer starts.

  //
  // A line's worth of fetching is about 3,280 core cycles at 80 MHz and four
  // dense layers want roughly 6,456, so the budget can be exceeded — see
  // docs/m1-m4-plan.md and task 2a in HANDOFF. When it is, line_start arrives
  // while the sequencer is still in Q_RUN, the bank does not flip and the
  // previous line is displayed again.
  //

  // from the outside: the picture is merely wrong. Counted here so "the image

  // answers it and cannot saturate: a frame has 384 lines.
  output logic [15:0] dbg_ovr_frame,

  // WHICH TILEMAPS ARE ACTUALLY REACHING THE SCREEN.
  //
  // The mixer already decides which slot wins every pixel, so counting wins per
  // tilemap per frame turns "is this layer being drawn?" from an inference into a
  // number. Both of this project's 2D faults would have been obvious at a glance
  // here: the row mask left one layer painting solid over the others, and the
  // window mode had tilemap 3 covering the picture while tilemap 2 drew nothing.
  //
  // Counted per frame and latched at vblank, so the value is a whole frame's
  // worth rather than a partial sweep.
  //
  // WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE. All four tilemaps are composited every
  // frame in a FIXED order — tilemap 0 nearest, 3 furthest, the 3D layer between
  // the two category passes — and each pixel shows the frontmost non-transparent
  // contributor. So this counts which layer WON a pixel, not whether a layer was
  // fetched. A layer reading zero may be drawing perfectly and simply be covered
  // by something in front of it.
  //
  // It is therefore an alarm, not a proof: a layer that has content in tile RAM
  // and wins nothing anywhere is worth investigating, and both of this project's
  // 2D faults would have shown up that way. Proving the composite is RIGHT needs
  // a frame diff against the reference, which is a different instrument.
  //
  // Saturating: a count that wraps reads as a small number and says the opposite
  // of what happened.
  //
  // EIGHTEEN BITS, NOT SIXTEEN. A full visible frame is 496 x 384 = 190,464
  // pixels, so a 16-bit counter saturates at 65,535 — barely a third of one
  // screen. That is not a corner case: a layer painting an opaque fill over
  // everything, which is the exact fault this was built to find, pins at the
  // maximum and reads identically to a layer covering a small window. It did,
  // and the saturated value was quoted as evidence for a frame.

  // mean the pair is not displayed. It means the pair is drawn as a VERTICAL
  // SPLIT at scanline v, tilemap 2 above and tilemap 3 below, which is a horizon:
  // it is the sky and the sea. Suppressing the pair paints the screen with
  // palette 0 instead, which is blue, at whatever rate the game toggles the mode.
  //
  // Fixing it, in order of what the reference actually uses:
  //   1. mode 1, hscr bit 15 clear — a per-SCANLINE layer pick, y >= v selects the
  //      other map of the pair. Cheap here: the renderer is already per-scanline
  //      and cur_line is to hand.
  //   2. modes 2/3, hscr bit 15 clear — a per-PIXEL split at x = h, which is a
  //      column mask and can reuse the row-mask machinery.
  //   3. hscr bit 15 SET — the per-line H-scroll table at 0x4000 + 0x200*layer.
  //      Not reached by anything measured so far; do it last.
  // The reference model in tb_m2_video.cpp encoded the same misreading and was
  // corrected with this. Reinstating the term below now fails 4,330 checks —
  // verified by doing it, after a first attempt reported the suite as unable to
  // discriminate the fix at all. That was wrong: the fixture had hscr bit 15 SET,
  // and the faulty term was `!win_hs || ...`, so the fault was simply unreachable
  // from it. The game keeps hscr below 0x0200, the fixture now does too.
  //
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------- FIXED, mode 1
  //
  // MODE 1 IS THE VERTICAL SPLIT AND IS NOW CORRECT IN BOTH hscr CASES. The
  // per-scanline pick above is what MAME does either side of `if (hscr & 0x8000)`:
  // bit 15 set walks the scanlines applying the per-line H-scroll table and flips
  // the map at `y >= v`; bit 15 clear clips two rectangles at the same `v`. The
  // LAYER SELECTION is identical, so `win_hs` does not belong in it at all — only
  // in where the horizontal scroll comes from, which is item 3 below.
  //
  // MODES 2 AND 3 SPLIT HORIZONTALLY, at x = hscr & 0x1ff, and that is a per-pixel
  // decision this scanline-at-a-time suppress cannot express. They stay suppressed
  // — the pre-existing behaviour — because drawing the vertically-picked map for a
  // horizontal split would be wrong in a way that looks plausible on screen, and a
  // wrong picture that looks reasonable is worse here than a missing one. Measured
  // use: pair 0/1 takes ctrl = 0x4000 on 130 frames of 2,065, so this is real but
  // it is not the sky and sea.
  //
  // Still owed, in order:
  //   1. modes 2/3 as a per-pixel column split at x = h, layer ^= 1 when
  //      !(hscr & 0x200). The row-mask path in m2_tile_fetch masks in 8-pixel
  //      groups; this needs finer, so it is a change there rather than here.
  //   2. hscr bit 15 set — the per-line H-scroll table at 0x4000 + 0x200*layer.
  //      Affects the scroll VALUE, not which map draws, so mode 1 is already right
  //      about the split without it. Nothing measured reaches it.
