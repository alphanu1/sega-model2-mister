// Scanline fetch engine for one tilemap layer.
//
// Walks the visible tile columns of one scanline, reads the tile word from
// on-chip tile RAM, fetches the character row from external memory, and writes
// eight palette indices into a line buffer. One instance per layer; the mixer
// combines the four line buffers during scanout.
//
// WHY THIS IS FETCHED A ROW AT A TIME AND NOT A PIXEL AT A TIME
//
// Character RAM is 512 KB and lives in SDRAM (D8) because it will not fit in
// M10K beside D3's band buffer. The budget is tight enough that the access
// pattern is the design:
//
//   62 visible tile columns x 2 char words x 4 layers  = 496 words per line
//   a scanline is 656 pixel clocks at 16 MHz           ~ 41 us
//   at 100 MHz that is                                 ~ 4100 cycles
//   at the measured 14.2 cycles per 4-word burst       ~ 3520 cycles
//
// It fits, with about 15% margin, and only because each fetch brings back a
// whole 8-pixel row rather than a pixel. Fetching per pixel would need eight
// times the transactions and miss by a mile. The margin is thin enough that
// bw_monitor's per-master figures are the thing to watch when the V60 and the
// TGP are competing for the same controller.
//
// A SCREEN COLUMN IS NOT A MAP TILE
//
// The first version walked 8-pixel screen columns and fetched one tile word
// per column. That is only correct when the horizontal scroll is a multiple of
// eight. `map_x = x - hscr`, so with any other scroll a single screen column
// straddles two map tiles, and using the first tile's word for all eight
// pixels puts a slice of the wrong character on every column boundary across
// the whole screen.
//
// So the walk is driven by the tile address changing, not by column
// boundaries: it steps one pixel at a time and refetches only when the address
// the decode computes actually moves. The traffic is the same — the address
// still changes at most once per eight pixels — but it is now correct at any
// scroll value.
//
// A REPEATED TILE IS NOT REFETCHED
//
// Text layers are mostly one font: the same handful of character codes recur
// across a line, and a service menu is largely one blank tile. Holding the
// last fetched character row and reusing it when the next column names the
// same tile and row costs one comparator and removes most of the traffic on
// exactly the screens M1 has to boot. It is not a cache — one entry, no tags
// beyond the address it already has — but on this content it is most of the
// benefit of one.

// THIS ENGINE IS LATENCY-BOUND, AND THAT IS THE THING TO FIX
//
// Measured per layer per scanline: 1,614 cycles on distinct tiles, of which
// 496 are emitting pixels and **1,118 are spent waiting**. 69% idle.
//
// The state machine below is strictly serialized — S_TILE, S_TILE_WAIT, S_CHAR
// (request, then stall for the ~14-cycle SDRAM latency), S_EMIT for eight
// pixels, repeat. Nothing overlaps, so every column pays the full memory
// latency in series.
//
// The consequence is that the CLOCK CANNOT FIX IT. Four dense layers need
// 6,456 cycles against 3,280 available in a scanline at 80 MHz; closing that by
// frequency alone would take ~157 MHz, which this device will not give. Anyone
// arriving here because four layers do not fit should not go looking for a
// faster clock or spend S32_V60_NO_FP on it.
//
// What does fix it: the SDRAM side is nowhere near saturated. 62 bursts per
// layer at ~9 cycles each on an open row is ~558 cycles, so prefetching two or
// three columns ahead — hiding the latency behind the eight cycles of emission
// already happening — makes a layer cost max(emit, fetch) ~= 560 instead of
// emit + wait = 1,614. Four layers then fit in ~2,240 cycles with room spare.
//
// A second lever after that: char_data is 32 bits, which is eight 4bpp pixels
// arriving at once, and S_EMIT currently spends eight cycles writing them one
// at a time. A wider line-buffer write takes emission from 496 cycles to 62.
//
// Full working in docs/m1-m4-plan.md, "Where the 1,614 cycles go".
