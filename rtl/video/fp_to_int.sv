// IEEE-754 single to int32, truncating toward zero - the conversion that turns a
// projected coordinate into a pixel.
//
// THE OUT-OF-RANGE RESULT IS INT32_MIN, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
//
// MAME assigns a float straight into `spoint_t`'s int members, so the behaviour
// that reaches the rasterizer is the host's. On x86 `cvttss2si` returns
// 0x80000000 - "integer indefinite" - for a NaN, an infinity, or any magnitude
// too large for the type, rather than saturating. MAME's own comment on
// draw_wireframe_line says so outright: "a degenerate projection yields inf/NaN,
// which float->int conversion turns into INT32_MIN on x86 hosts", and it clips
// the line precisely because that value arrives. Saturating instead would be the
// tidier arithmetic and the wrong picture: a vertex that MAME throws to the far
// left would sit on the right-hand edge.
//
// Hard rule 4 - reproduce the quirk, comment why, move on.
//
// Combinational: a shift and a negate. The caller registers it.
