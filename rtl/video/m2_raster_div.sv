// Edge-slope divider for the quad filler.
//
// The only real arithmetic in the whole rasterizer. fill_quad computes a slope
// per edge event as
//
//     sl = (x_here - x_next) / (y_here - y_next)
//
// on int32 operands, so this must be C integer division: **truncating toward
// zero**, not floor. The two differ for exactly the negative-quotient case,
// which is every left-leaning edge, and the error is one LSB of a 16.16
// accumulator per scanline. That drifts a whole pixel over 65536 scanlines and
// a fraction of one over any real polygon — invisible in a directed test,
// caught by a frame diff a long way downstream. Magnitude-divide then negate
// gives truncation for free, which is why it is done that way here.
//
// RADIX-4 RESTORING DIVISION, two quotient bits per cycle, 16 cycles.
//
// It was radix-2 at 32 cycles, on the note that setup runs at most four times
// per quad and never per pixel, and that the lever if it ever hurt was radix-4
// or a reciprocal table - "a measurement to take rather than a guess to build".
//
// The measurement was taken. sim/video/tb_m2_raster3d.cpp, the reference's own
// frame 900 swept against a real raster:
//
//     FILLW  3,487,790 cycles over 8 passes = 436,000 a frame, of 818,133
//
// and the quad count says 275 cycles of fill per quad against at most eight
// divides of 32. The divider IS the fill.
//
// Radix-4 needs three multiples of the divisor - d, 2d, 3d - compared against
// the shifted remainder, and 3d is the only one that is not a shift. The
// quotient is exact integer division either way, so the result is bit-identical
// to the radix-2 version and tb_m2_raster_fill's 152,025 checks are unchanged.
//
// Radix-8 would want seven multiples for another 5 cycles; that is where this
// stops being worth it.

  // A RECIPROCAL TABLE INSTEAD OF SIXTEEN RESTORING STEPS.
  //
  // The edge-slope divide is 47% of the worst band's fill (tb_m2_raster3d on
  // the reference's frame 5460: 12,597 of 26,808 cycles, 663 segments at 19
  // cycles each), and a band that overruns its beam slot is presented late -
  // on the board that is the top band of the 3D missing. So the latency of
  // this unit, not the number of divides, is what to attack.
  //
  // The fast path is exact, not approximate. recip[d] = ceil(2^32/d), so
  //     q_est = (n * recip[d]) >> 32  =  n/d + n*e/(d*2^32),  0 <= e < d
  // and since e < d the error term is under n/2^32, which is under 1 for any
  // 32-bit numerator. So q_est is floor(n/d) or exactly one more, whatever
  // the numerator, and one multiply-compare corrects it. Four cycles instead
  // of nineteen, bit-identical - tb_m2_raster_fill's 152,025 checks compare
  // against the same C++ reference either way.
  //
  // THE NUMERATOR IS 16.16, NOT A PIXEL COUNT. m2_raster_fill walks its edges
  // in 16.16 fixed point, so a numerator is a screen difference shifted left
  // 16 and reaches 2^25. A first cut bounded the fast path at 2^18 on the
  // reasoning that these are screen coordinates, and every divide in the
  // heavy bands went down the slow path - the measurement said 16 cycles a
  // divide with the table in place, which is what caught it.
  //
  // Only |den| >= TN falls back to the restoring divider, so the unit stays
  // correct for every input the way it always was.
