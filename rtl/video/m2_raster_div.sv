// Edge-slope divider for the quad filler.
//
// The only real arithmetic in the whole rasterizer. fill_quad computes a slope
// per edge event as
//
//     sl = (x_here - x_next) / (y_here - y_next)
//
// on int32 operands, so this must be C integer division: **truncating toward
// zero**, not floor. The two differ for exactly the negative-quotient case,
// which is every left-leaning edge, and the error is one LSB of a 16.16
// accumulator per scanline. That drifts a whole pixel over 65536 scanlines and
// a fraction of one over any real polygon — invisible in a directed test,
// caught by a frame diff a long way downstream. Magnitude-divide then negate
// gives truncation for free, which is why it is done that way here.
//
// RADIX-4 RESTORING DIVISION, two quotient bits per cycle, 16 cycles.
//
// It was radix-2 at 32 cycles, on the note that setup runs at most four times
// per quad and never per pixel, and that the lever if it ever hurt was radix-4
// or a reciprocal table - "a measurement to take rather than a guess to build".
//
// The measurement was taken. sim/video/tb_m1_raster3d.cpp, the reference's own
// frame 900 swept against a real raster:
//
//     FILLW  3,487,790 cycles over 8 passes = 436,000 a frame, of 818,133
//
// and the quad count says 275 cycles of fill per quad against at most eight
// divides of 32. The divider IS the fill.
//
// Radix-4 needs three multiples of the divisor - d, 2d, 3d - compared against
// the shifted remainder, and 3d is the only one that is not a shift. The
// quotient is exact integer division either way, so the result is bit-identical
// to the radix-2 version and tb_m1_raster_fill's 152,025 checks are unchanged.
//
// Radix-8 would want seven multiples for another 5 cycles; that is where this
// stops being worth it.
