//
// THIS REPLACES A HAND-ROLLED VERSION WRITTEN HERE FIRST, and the reason is
// worth keeping. That one gave the stage a PRIVATE fp_mul and fp_add and
// waited for each result before issuing the next operation -- one stage of a
// four-stage pipeline, three idle. Model 1 had already built exactly that,
// measured it, and replaced it with the shared pool: a polygon record needs
// 44 multiplies and 43 adds against a 68-cycle budget, and the pipelines
// retire one result a cycle, so ONE of each runs at 65%. Private units cost
// two multipliers and two adders and buy nothing.
//
// Model 2 uses the same 3x4 matrix from the same display-list opcode (0x0b),
// so the interface is unchanged. apply_focus is Model 2-specific and is a
// separate stage; this block is transform_point and transform_vector only.

// The geometry stage's matrix transform: a point through the 3x4 view matrix.
//
// Behavioural contract is MAME's model1_v.cpp view_t::transform_point (:38) and
// transform_vector (:48):
//
//     xx = m[0]*x + m[3]*y + m[6]*z + m[ 9]
//     yy = m[1]*x + m[4]*y + m[7]*z + m[10]
//     zz = m[2]*x + m[5]*y + m[8]*z + m[11]
//
// transform_vector is the same without the m[9..11] column, and is what the
// polygon's normal goes through - a direction has no origin, so translating it
// would be wrong.
//
// THE YAW IS NOT IMPLEMENTED, AND THAT IS CORRECT. transform_point ends with
//
//     p->x = ayyc * xx - ayys * zz;
//     p->z = ayys * xx + ayyc * zz;
//
// which looks like a second rotation and is not one: `ayy` is only ever written
// inside an `#if 0` debug free-camera (model1_v.cpp:1793-1842), so it is always
// 0, ayyc is always 1 and ayys always 0, and the pair reduces to x = xx, z = zz.
// Building it would cost four multiplies and two adds per point - about 12% of
// this module's arithmetic - to compute an identity. Checked before omitting.
//
// WHY IT IS BIT-EXACT AGAINST MAME AND NOT MERELY CLOSE
//
// MAME evaluates the geometry in host `float`, and fp_mul and fp_add are fuzzed
// against host float directly (sim/tgp/tb_fp_mul.cpp: "reference is the host C
// float, matching MAME's evaluation model"). So the same operations in the same
// ORDER give the same bits, and the order is what this module is careful about:
// floating-point addition is not associative, and summing the three products
// left to right rather than as a balanced tree is a different answer in the last
// place. MAME sums left to right. So does this.
//
// SCHEDULING, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT FORCED IT
//
// A polygon record needs THREE transforms - two points and the normal - and the
// budget is 68 cycles a record (docs/findings.md: 5,831 records in a peak frame,
// 818,133 cycles - see the note on the budget in rtl/video/m1_raster3d.sv).
//
// The obvious structure - issue nine multiplies, wait for all nine, then three
// rounds of adds each drained before the next - was built first and MEASURED at
// **40 cycles a transform, 120 a record, 1.76x over budget**. The multiplier is
// idle for 31 of those 40 cycles. That is what the throughput case in the bench
// exists to catch, and it caught it.
//
// So the multiply and add phases are separate stages that run CONCURRENTLY on
// different points, and the products live in a ping-pong bank so the adds of
// point N-1 can read one bank while the multiplies of point N fill the other.
//
// The add schedule is fixed and spaced, not packed:
//
//     ac  0  1  2   |  5  6  7   |  10 11 12
//         round 0      round 1      round 2
//
// Three-cycle gaps, not two. fp_add's latency is 4, so round 1's first add reads
// a t[] the round-0 result must already have been WRITTEN to - issuing it on the
// cycle that result arrives reads the old value, because the capture is
// non-blocking. One cycle of slack is the difference between a correct sum and a
// stale one, and it is invisible in a wave until the numbers are compared.
