// The rasterizer's band buffer: spans in, pixels out.
//
// WHY A BAND AND NOT A FRAME (decision D3, and the arithmetic that forces it)
//
// The active picture is 496x384. A full framebuffer at 16bpp is 3,047,424 bits,
// which is 372 M10K of a 553-block device with 181 free - it does not fit and
// never did. One 64-row band is 496x64x17 = 539,648 bits, 62 blocks, and 124
// double-buffered. That is what makes the design possible on this part, and it
// is why the quads have to be binned by band and walked once per band rather
// than drawn in one pass.
//
// SEVENTEEN BITS, NOT SIXTEEN. The 3D composites OVER the tilemaps, so "this
// pixel was painted" has to be distinguishable from "this pixel is black" - a
// colour cannot carry that, because 0x0000 is a legal colour the game uses. The
// extra bit costs nothing: an M10K is 10,240 bits and a x20 configuration uses
// all of it, so 496x64x17 and 496x64x16 both land on 62 blocks. Picking 16 to
// save memory would have saved none and lost the distinction.
//
// The colour is RGB565. m2_palette carries RGB888 and the source entries are
// xBGR-555, so 16bpp costs no fidelity - docs/m3-rasterizer-spec.md makes the
// same point about the band's pixel format being a resource decision.
//
// ORDERING IS THE CALLER'S JOB. Model 1 has no Z-buffer: it paints back to
// front, and the sort is in the rasterizer stage (model1_v.cpp:535, z
// descending with submission order as the tie-break). This module therefore
// paints unconditionally - the last write to a pixel wins - and a caller that
// feeds spans out of order gets a wrong picture with no complaint from here.
// That is the same contract MAME's fill_quad has.
//
// MOIRE is a stipple, not a blend: fill_quad's moired variant writes only where
// `!((x ^ y) & 1)`, so half the pixels are left showing whatever was behind.
// Reproduced exactly, including that it is tested against the SCREEN x and y,
// not against the span's own coordinates - a stipple keyed to the span would
// walk with the polygon instead of standing still on the screen.
