//   r = pal5bit((v >> 0)  & 0x1f)
//   g = pal5bit((v >> 5)  & 0x1f)
//   b = pal5bit((v >> 10) & 0x1f)

// BIT 15 IS INTENSITY, NOT PADDING
//
// The layout looks like plain xBGR-555 with a spare top bit, and MAME's own
// comment records that reading it that way is wrong:
//
//   "Bit 15 is an intensity/shade bit, not unused as the plain xBGR_555 decode
//    assumes. Almost every entry has it set (full brightness); a handful clear
//    it to render dimmed (e.g. Star Wars Arcade's grey menu backdrop pen
//    0x7777). Halve the channels when it is clear so those pens stop reading
//    too bright."
//
// That is a fix somebody made after seeing a specific game look wrong, and it
// is invisible in almost all content — "almost every entry has it set" — so a
// core that drops it looks correct until one screen in one game is too bright.
// Reproduced rather than simplified, per hard rule 4.
//
// pal5bit is MAME's 5-to-8 expansion: (x << 3) | (x >> 2), which replicates the
// top bits into the low ones so 0x1f maps to 0xff rather than 0xf8.
