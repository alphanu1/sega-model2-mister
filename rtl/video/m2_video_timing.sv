// Video timing, from MAME's screen configuration in model1.cpp:
//
//   m_screen->set_raw(XTAL(16'000'000), 656, 0, 496, 424, 0, 384);
//
// 16 MHz pixel clock, 656 total columns of which 496 are visible, 424 total
// lines of which 384 are visible. That gives 16e6 / (656 * 424) = 57.52 Hz,
// which is the refresh the whole core has to hit — the tilemap fetch budget in
// m1_tile_fetch.sv is derived from the 656-clock line this defines.
//
// WHERE THE SYNC PULSES SIT IS NOT FROM MAME
//
// `set_raw` specifies the total and the visible window; it says nothing about
// where inside the blanking interval the sync pulses go, because MAME does not
// need to know. A real display does, so the positions below are chosen rather
// than derived, and are parameters so they can be corrected against a real
// board or a service-mode geometry screen without touching logic.
//
// The totals and the visible window ARE from MAME and must not be adjusted to
// make a monitor happy: they set the frame rate, and a core that runs at the
// wrong rate has audio that drifts and scrolling that tears in ways that look
// like unrelated bugs.

// LIFTED FROM THE MODEL 1 CORE, UNCHANGED except for the module name and these
// comments. Source: sega-model1-mister rtl/video/m1_video_timing.sv at f48c842.
// Recorded in THIRD_PARTY.md.
//
// It transfers with NO retiming, which was not expected -- docs/milestones.md
// carried "retimed to 496x384" until this was checked. MAME declares the two
// machines identically:
//
//   Model 1: set_raw(XTAL(16'000'000),  656, 0, 496, 424, 0, 384)
//   Model 2: set_raw(32_MHz_XTAL/2,     656, 0, 496, 424, 0, 384)
//
// Same pixel clock, same totals, same visible window. 16e6 / (656 * 424) =
// 57.52 Hz.
