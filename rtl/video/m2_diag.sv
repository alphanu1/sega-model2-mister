// Debug words painted over the picture as HEX DIGITS, readable off a photograph.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// A core on a bench has one output channel. When the board showed a solid white
// raster the simulator was showing the game's test-mode screen from the same
// RTL and the same ROM, so every remaining hypothesis was about something
// simulation cannot model — SDRAM on real silicon, the ROM arriving over ioctl,
// pin timing — and each one cost a twenty-five minute Quartus build to test,
// answered only by "still white".
//
// WHY DIGITS AND NOT BLOCKS
//
// The first version drew each word as 32 blocks, one per bit, with a green rule
// every four so hex could be counted off the photo. It worked, and it found two
// real faults. But reading it means locating a cell boundary to a few pixels in
// a photograph of a screen, and a phone camera against an LCD adds moiré that
// lands exactly on an 8-pixel pitch. Three values were misread that way over one
// session, twice sending the next experiment after the wrong subsystem.
//
// An instrument that is hard to read is a source of wrong answers, not a
// defence against them. So the same words are drawn as eight hex digits in a
// 5x7 font, which a camera resolves unambiguously and a human reads without
// counting anything.
//
// GEOMETRY
//
// Glyphs are 8x8 in the font and drawn at 2x, so each digit is a 16x16 cell and
// a row of eight digits is 128 pixels. Both are powers of two: the digit index
// and the pixel within it come out as bit slices rather than dividers, which
// keeps this off the critical path of a design already fighting for Fmax.
//
// POSITION IS RECOVERED FROM BLANKING, NOT PASSED IN
//
// The counters could come from m1_video_timing, which has them. They are
// rebuilt here from hb/vb instead so this can sit at the top level between the
// core and the framework's video ports, on the finished pixel stream, without
// the video path knowing it exists. An instrument that requires modifying the
// thing it measures is worth less.

// LIFTED FROM THE MODEL 1 CORE, unchanged but for the module name and header.
// Source: sega-model1-mister rtl/video/m1_diag.sv at b895e6c. THIRD_PARTY.md.
//
// It exists here for the same reason it exists there, and P1.5 puts it BEFORE
// the first board test rather than after the fifth failed one: from step 3
// onwards this core has an SDRAM controller, a ROM arriving over ioctl and a
// tilemap fetcher, none of which simulation can prove on real silicon, and each
// wrong guess costs a Quartus build to test.
