// Tilemap priority mixer.
//
// Transcribed from model1_v.cpp's screen_update, which draws in this order:
//
//   m_tiles->draw(..., 6, 0, TILEMAP_DRAW_OPAQUE);
//   m_tiles->draw(..., 4, 0, TILEMAP_DRAW_OPAQUE);
//   m_tiles->draw(..., 2, 0, 0);
//   m_tiles->draw(..., 0, 0, 0);
//        ... the 3D image is composited here ...
//   m_tiles->draw(..., 7, 0, 0);
//   m_tiles->draw(..., 5, 0, 0);
//   m_tiles->draw(..., 3, 0, 0);
//   m_tiles->draw(..., 1, 0, 0);
//
// EACH TILEMAP IS DRAWN TWICE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
//
// There are eight draw calls but only four tilemaps. In draw_common the layer
// argument splits: `layer >> 1` selects the tilemap and `tpri = layer & 1`
// selects which of its tiles that pass draws. So layer 6 is tilemap 3's
// category-0 tiles and layer 7 is tilemap 3's category-1 tiles — the same
// tilemap, filtered by the per-tile category bit, which is bit 15 of the tile
// word and arrives here as `prio`.
//
// The consequence is that a single tilemap straddles the 3D image: its
// category-0 tiles sit behind the polygons and its category-1 tiles sit in
// front. That is how the hardware puts a cockpit frame over the 3D view while
// the same layer's background sits behind it. Treating each tilemap as
// occupying one depth would render the 3D either entirely over or entirely
// under it, which looks plausible in a static screenshot and is wrong the
// moment anything moves.
//
// Front-to-back, then, the nine slots are:
//
//   tm0.cat1, tm1.cat1, tm2.cat1, tm3.cat1, [3D], tm0.cat0, tm1.cat0,
//   tm2.cat0, tm3.cat0
//
// OPACITY
//
// Layers 6 and 4 — tilemaps 3 and 2, category 0 — are drawn with
// TILEMAP_DRAW_OPAQUE, so pen 0 is written rather than skipped. Everything
// else treats pen 0 as transparent. Without that the backdrop never gets
// filled and whatever the framebuffer held last frame shows through.

  // Per-pixel row-mask verdict, one bit per tilemap: the pixel's category does

  // segas24 masks a tilemap in 8-pixel columns from a table at tile_ram 0x6000
  // (tilemaps 0/1) or 0x6800 (2/3), four words per scanline. MAME draws each
  // tilemap twice — once per category — and inverts the mask for the second
  // pass (`win = layer & 1`, `if(win) m = ~m`), so a column shows exactly one
  // of the two categories: whichever equals its mask bit. m2_tile_fetch reduces
  // that to this one bit per pixel.
  //
  // Gated here rather than folded into `transparent` because tilemaps 2 and 3
