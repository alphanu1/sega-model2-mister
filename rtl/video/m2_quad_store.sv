// The quad store and the painter's sort.
//
// Model 1 has no Z-buffer: draw_quads paints z DESCENDING with ties broken by
// submission order (quad_t::compare, model1_v.cpp:535), so every quad of a
// viewport has to be collected before any of it can be drawn. This holds them,
// sorts them, and replays them in order - once per band, because the band buffer
// covers 64 of 384 rows and the same list is walked for each.
//
// WHY A RADIX SORT AND NOT A COMPARISON SORT
//
// A comparison sort needs the quads reachable in a random order while it works.
// An LSD radix sort touches them strictly in sequence and only ever moves an
// INDEX, so the quads themselves sit still in one wide memory and the sort works
// on 11-bit indices - two arrays of 2,048, which is a handful of M10K rather than
// a second copy of the store. Four passes of eight bits over a 32-bit key is
// 4 x 2,048 reads and writes, nothing against a frame.
//
// It is also STABLE, which is what makes the tie-break free: MAME resolves equal
// z by submission order, and a stable sort that starts in submission order keeps
// it without the key ever mentioning it.
//
// THE KEY IS THE FLOAT, MADE MONOTONIC. IEEE floats compare as sign-magnitude, so
// a raw integer compare is wrong across zero. The standard transform - invert a
// negative entirely, set the sign bit of a positive - makes the unsigned integer
// order match the float order. Then the key is COMPLEMENTED, because the sort is
// ascending and the painter wants descending.
//
// OVERFLOW IS COUNTED, NOT SILENT. A frame with more quads than the store holds
// drops the excess and says so. A real frame measured 2,001 quads and a peak frame
// 4,798 records of which not all emit, so 2,048 is the right order and the counter
// is how we find out if it is not.
