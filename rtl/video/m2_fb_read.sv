// THE DDR3 FRAMEBUFFER, READ BACK A LINE AT A TIME.
//
// This replaces the read side of m2_raster_band. The interface is deliberately
// the same -- rd_x, rd_row -> rd_col, rd_hit -- so m2_tile_mixer composites the
// 3D over the tilemap exactly as it does today and does not know the pixels
// now come from DDR3.
//
// ONE BURST A LINE, ISSUED A LINE EARLY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT.
// R347: this memory is ~200 ns typical and UNBOUNDED in the worst case because
// the bridge is shared with the ARM. Reading per pixel would put that in the
// beam's path. A line is 512 pixels at two per beat -- 256 beats, one command --
// and it is requested while the beam is still drawing the PREVIOUS line:
//
//     a line at 6 MHz pixel clock is ~30 us of slack
//     the burst itself is 256 beats, ~2.6 us at 100 MHz
//     the latency it amortises is ~200 ns -- under 8% of the transfer
//
// So the worst case has an order of magnitude of room before anything is late,
// where a per-pixel read would have none. The same arithmetic is why the
// Z80 and the sample fetchers are a HARDER problem than the framebuffer, not an
// easier one (R347).
//
// TWO LINE BUFFERS, IN M10K. 2 x 512 x 25 bits is about 26 Kbit, three blocks,
// against the twenty-four the three band buffers cost. The net is twenty-one
// blocks back on a device that reads 553 of 553.
