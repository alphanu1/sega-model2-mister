// The i8251 (T82C51) either end of the sound link.
//
// daytona93 is model2o, and its sound board is the MODEL 1 board -- model2.cpp
// instantiates SEGAM1AUDIO, the same device model1.cpp uses. The two boards talk
// over a serial pair and nothing else: the i960 has an i8251 at 0x01c80000 and
// the sound board's 68000 has one at 0xc20000, wired
//
//     m_uart->txd_handler().set(m_m1audio, &segam1audio_device::write_txd)
//     m_m1audio->rxd_handler().set(m_uart, &i8251_device::write_rxd)
//
// at 16 MHz / 2 / 16 -- "16 times 31.25kHz (standard Sega/MIDI sound data rate)".
//
// BYTE-LEVEL, NOT BIT-LEVEL, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE HLE.
//
// Both ends are configured identically by their own firmware and the only thing
// either program can observe is the BYTE STREAM and the rate it arrives at. A
// bit-serial model would reproduce the same bytes at the same times through ten
// times the logic and a shift register nobody can see. So this carries bytes and
// paces them at the real 31.25 kHz, which keeps the one property the software
// depends on -- a byte takes ~32 us, so the sender cannot outrun the receiver.
//
// It is written down as an approximation rather than left to be discovered:
// framing errors, break detection and parity are NOT modelled, because neither
// firmware can produce them across a board-to-board link that is always
// configured the same way at both ends. If a game is ever found that reads the
// error bits meaningfully, this is the file that has to grow.
//
// THE ORACLE. MAME emits exactly 59 bytes to this port over 900 frames of
// attract mode, beginning
//
//     00 x11, f8, f8, ff, be 14 1f, be 16 02, be 1b 17, ...
//
// so the i960 side can be verified byte for byte before a single sound chip
// exists. That is the whole reason this piece is built first.

// No baud parameter here on purpose: the PACING lives in m2_sound_link, which
// is the wire. This end only ever sees "the byte was taken" and "a byte
// arrived", exactly as the real part sees its shift register empty or full.
