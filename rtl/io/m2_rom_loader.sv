// MRA ROM loader: HPS ioctl stream -> SDRAM download port + TGP program RAM.
//
// STREAM LAYOUT IS THE SDRAM LAYOUT
//
// The MRA pads every region to a fixed size and emits them in the order the
// SDRAM map expects, so for everything that lives in external memory the
// address mapping is the identity: stream byte N is SDRAM byte N. There is
// deliberately no per-region base-address arithmetic here.
//
// That is not laziness, it is where the bugs are. s32's loader carries six
// region offsets computed from each other, and a loader that adds the wrong
// base puts a whole ROM region at the wrong address — which does not fail at
// load time, it fails much later as a game that boots to garbage, and the
// evidence points at the CPU rather than at the loader. Making the MRA
// responsible for layout means a region can only be misplaced by editing the
// MRA, where it is visible, rather than by arithmetic in RTL.

// 31 MB of SDRAM, fitting a single 32 MB module, so D2 holds.
//
// Sized from MEASURED ROM extents across all ten dumped Model 1 games, not
// from MAME's ROM_REGION declarations. Those are upper bounds and total 33 MB,
// which would not fit — and concluding that D2 fails on the strength of them
// would have been wrong.
//
// The V60's four sub-regions are the one place the stream is not a plain copy
// of a MAME region, because `maincpu` is sparse: it spans 19.5 MB of address
// space holding 5.5 MB of ROM, with the program at 0x200000, the boot vectors
// at 0xf80000 and the banked data ROMs at 0x1000000. Storing that sparsely
// would spend 19.5 MB of the module on 5.5 MB of ROM. The MRA packs it, and
// m1_decode maps V60 addresses onto the packed layout — that mapping belongs
// with the decode because it is a property of the V60's address space, which
// is fixed silicon, rather than of the stream, which the MRA controls.
//
// The TGP program ROM is the one exception, because it is 32-bit and lives in
// the TGP's own program memory rather than external RAM. Two 16-bit ioctl
// words assemble into one 32-bit program word, low half first.
//
// BACKPRESSURE
//
// `ioctl_wait` tells the HPS to stop, but it does not stop instantly — the
// host has already-issued transfers in flight when it sees the signal. A
// loader that asserts wait and assumes the very next write will not arrive
// drops ROM bytes, and a dropped byte is a corrupt ROM that passes its own
// load and fails a checksum much later.
//
// So writes go into a short FIFO and `ioctl_wait` asserts while it still has
// room to absorb what is already in flight, not once it is full. `overflow`
// exists so a testbench can assert that the depth was actually sufficient
// rather than assuming it.
