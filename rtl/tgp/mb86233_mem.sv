//
// THE MAP IS NARROWER THAN THIS REPO'S DOCS SAID. copro_data_map is:
//
//   0x0000-0x00ff  RAM bank 0, 256 words
//   0x0100         copro_fifo_in,  READ only, ONE address
//   0x0200-0x03ff  RAM bank 1, 512 words
//   0x0400         copro_fifo_out, WRITE only, ONE address
//
// docs/m0-mb86233-spike.md described this as "accesses to 0x100-0x1ff and
// 0x400+ route externally", which implied two external windows of 256 and
// 64K words. There is exactly one address at each end, one direction each.
// Everything else in the space is unmapped and reads as zero.
//
// The distinction matters for the +0x200 adder: an EA of 0x200 landing on the
// output FIFO is the documented trick (x1 = 0x200 plus the adder), and it works
// precisely because 0x400 is a single decoded address rather than a window that
// a stray address could fall into unnoticed.
