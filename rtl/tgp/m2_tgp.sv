//   AS_PROGRAM  0x000-0x7ff   microcode ROM, 2048 words = 315-5573.bin exactly
//   AS_DATA     internal RAM, with the two FIFOs forwarded out at 0x0100/0x0400
//   AS_IO       copro RAM window, four math units, and a 2 MB data-ROM window
//   AS_RF       LEDs, discarded
//
// THE TGP's COPRO RAM RULE IS NOT THE V60's
//
// It has FOUR address registers, selected by IO address bits 4:3 — MAME's
// `.select(0x18)` with `m_copro_ram_adr[offset >> 3]` — and its increment is
// unconditional, stepping by FOUR when bit 18 of the register is set and by one
// otherwise. The V60's single register increments only when its bit 15 is set,
// and always by one. Two different rules on the same RAM; keeping each side's
// registers on its own side is what makes that tractable.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE YET
//
// The four math units and the data-ROM window are brought out as external ports
// rather than implemented inside. Both are table lookups into memory far too
// large for M10K — 256 KB of tables and 2 MB of data — so they belong in SDRAM,
// and the integrator owns that. The ports exist so the core can be exercised
// against a testbench that serves them from the extracted ROMs.
