// Single-chip 16-bit SDR SDRAM controller with a per-master round-robin
// arbiter, for the port map in docs/00-decisions.md D8.
//
// PROVENANCE
//
// The state machine follows meathax's System 32 controller
// (third_party/s32/rtl/mem/sdram.sv, GPL-3.0, so licence-compatible per D7).
// That is deliberate. It encodes two hazards that were found the hard way and
// are invisible from a datasheet:
//
//   - Requests must be latched on the REQUEST RISING EDGE, not sampled as a
//     level qualified by !pend && !ack. The level-sampled version has a
//     one-cycle drop window: a requester that issues its next request in
//     direct response to an ack presents a pulse whose first cycle is blocked
//     by the still-clearing pend and whose second by the stretched ack. The
//     transaction vanishes and the port hangs forever. Which transactions hit
//     the window depends on arbitration history, so it appears as "adding an
//     unrelated master broke the CPU".
//
//   - Completion must clear pend on the ack RISING EDGE and must do so BEFORE
//     the new-request latch in the same process, so a chained request landing
//     on the very edge that clears pend wins rather than vanishing.
//
// Reimplementing from scratch would have meant rediscovering both.
//
// WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE
//
//   - Ports are a generic array rather than six copy-pasted blocks. Six
//     near-identical hand-written port blocks is six chances to transpose an
//     index, and the arbiter becomes a loop instead of a priority ladder
//     repeated once per rotation position.
//   - Any port may write. D8 puts V60 work RAM in external memory, so p0
//     needs a write path; s32's read ports are read-only because all of its
//     RAM is internal.
//   - DQ is split into dq_i/dq_o/dq_oe. The tri-state lives at the top level
//     where the physical pin is, which keeps this module and the device model
//     straightforwardly simulatable.
//   - Timing is parameterised, in clock cycles, and the same numbers are
//     handed to sdram_model in simulation. Hardcoded cycle counts silently
//     stop being correct when the clock changes, and nothing catches it.
//   - dbg_req/dbg_grant are brought out for bw_monitor, so telemetry does not
//     have to reach inside the module.
//
// REQUEST CONTRACT
//
// One transaction per request RISING EDGE. The address, write data and byte
// enables are sampled on that edge. A request held high is serviced exactly
// once — a requester expecting re-service per ack from a held level will
// hang. Requesters must be single-outstanding.

  // p3 is the coprocessor's read-only regions — copro_data and the math tables.
  // A coprocessor fetch is one 32-bit word, so it needs TWO 16-bit words, and

  // THAT DERIVATION IS AGAINST sdram_model, AND THE BOARD DISAGREES.

  // The model samples commands and presents data on the same clock edge the

  // so the device samples and drives half a period away, and the model's own
  // header says that forwarded-clock phase is "deliberately not modelled
  // here". Every term above is right and the total is still a simulation
  // figure.
  //
  // Measured on hardware: the assembled line came back shifted right by one
  // 16-bit word — the controller tagged the burst's word 1 as word 0. The
  // V60's reset vector read FE104E where the ROM holds 4EF3D6, which is
  // exactly bits [39:16] of the same burst. It hid for a session because the

  // 000d and a one-word shift is invisible.
  //
  // So the capture point is selectable at run time rather than guessed one
  // Quartus build at a time. `rd_lat_sel` picks CL+2 through CL+5; the
