// Clock-domain bridge for one m1_sdram port.
//
// WHY THE CORE HAS TWO CLOCKS AT ALL
//
// The V60 closes at 24.62 MHz and the tilemap fetch engine needs about 700
// cycles per layer per scanline on repeated tiles, 1,614 on distinct ones. A
// scanline is 656 pixel clocks at the 16 MHz dot clock, 41 us, so four layers
// want 2,796-6,456 core cycles — 68 MHz at the very least and closer to 100 for
// the video side. A clock enable does not help: `ce` decides when the CPU
// advances, but every path still has to meet setup at the actual clock.
//
// So the CPU sits in a slow domain and memory, ROM loading and video in a fast
// one, and this is what carries a memory port between them. The V60 can afford
// it: measured, 64-cycle memory latency costs it 1.8% (docs/m1-m4-plan.md,
// "V60 fetch"), and this bridge adds far less than that.
//
// THE TWO HANDSHAKES IT HAS TO SATISFY, WHICH ARE NOT THE SAME
//
//  * m1_sdram takes **one transaction per req RISING EDGE** and samples address,
//    write data and byte enables on that edge. A level held high is serviced
//    once, so the fast side must be given a clean edge, not a stretched level.
//
//  * m1_main pulses its request for a single cycle and latches read data on the
//    **ack rising edge**. So the slow side must be given an edge too, with data
//    already stable when it arrives.
//
// A level-crossing synchroniser satisfies neither. This is a two-phase toggle
// handshake: a toggle per request crossing one way, a toggle per completion
// crossing back, each edge-detected in its destination domain to make exactly
// one pulse.
//
// There is deliberately no guard against a completion toggle arriving with
// nothing outstanding. It cannot do harm — the slow side edge-detects the
// toggle *and* gates on a_busy, so a stray edge while idle is discarded and the
// next real completion is still just an edge. A guard was written, and mutation
// testing showed removing it changed nothing any test could observe, which by
// hard rule 5 makes it unverified code rather than defence in depth.
//
// Address, write data and byte enables cross without synchronisers on purpose.
// They are captured in a register that cannot change while a transaction is
// outstanding, and the destination only samples them two or more clocks after
// the toggle that announced them, by which point they have been stable for
// longer than any metastability window. Synchronising a 24-bit bus bit by bit
// would be actively wrong — the bits would arrive skewed.
