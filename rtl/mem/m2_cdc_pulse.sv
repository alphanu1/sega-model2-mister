// One-cycle pulse across a clock domain.
//
// Written for the vertical-blank interrupt. m1_video raises vblank_irq for a
// single clk_sys cycle, and the V60's interrupt controller is in the slow
// domain: at 96 MHz that pulse is about 10 ns, and a 24 MHz clock has a 42 ns
// period, so it can land entirely between two destination edges and simply not
// exist. A missing frame interrupt does not look like a clock-domain fault
// downstream — it looks like the game hanging in its vblank wait.
//
// A level would not do either, because the destination needs an edge per frame,
// not a state.
//
// So: toggle in the source, edge-detect in the destination. The toggle carries
// no data, which is what makes the crossing safe — a single bit that is stable
// between events cannot be sampled half-changed in any way that matters, and
// the two flops in the destination resolve the metastability.
//
// LIMIT, and why it is fine here: pulses closer together than about three
// destination clocks are merged, because the toggle has not been sampled twice
// before it flips again. vblank arrives at 57.52 Hz against a 24 MHz clock,
// which is roughly 417,000 destination cycles apart. Anything periodic and fast
// wants a FIFO instead, not this.
